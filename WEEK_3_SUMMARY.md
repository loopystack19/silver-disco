# Week 3: Food Security Hub (Farmers Module) - Implementation Summary

## Project: UmojaHub - Connecting Africa's Communities
**Module:** Food Security Hub (Farmers Marketplace)  
**Implementation Date:** February 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

  - Only verified users can create crop listings

- **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `src/types/user.ts` - Updated User interface

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### 1. Local-First Architecture
- All data stored in `db.json` using LowDB
- No external database dependencies
- Perfect for offline development and testing
- Easy to reset and seed with demo data

### 2. Email Verification Only
- Simplified from document-based verification
- Faster user onboarding
- Token-based system with expiry
- Can be extended to send actual emails in production

### 3. Kenyan Context
- All 47 Kenyan counties available for location selection
- Prices in Kenyan Shillings (KSh)
- Local crop types and farming terminology
- Realistic demo data for Kenyan market

### 4. User Experience
- Real-time filtering without page reloads
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Loading states and error handling
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. Security Considerations
- Email verification required for posting
- Users can only edit/delete their own listings
- Admins can delete any listing
- Session-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
