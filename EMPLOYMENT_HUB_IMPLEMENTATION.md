# Employment Hub Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Project Sprint Module - Fully Functional

### Overview
The Employment Hub has been successfully implemented based on the design specifications in `employment.md`. This module enables students to build real-world portfolio experience using publicly available data sources like Kaggle, GitHub, and public APIs.

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**Updated:** `src/lib/db.ts` and `src/types/user.ts`

Added three new collections to the database:
- **projects**: Stores project sprint definitions
