## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **LowDB limitations with concurrent users**
   - Mitigation: Plan early migration to MongoDB if >50 concurrent users
   - Backup: Use MongoDB Atlas free tier from Week 8 onwards

2. **Low-bandwidth performance issues**
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, image optimization from Day 1
   - Testing: Use Chrome DevTools network throttling weekly

3. **Offline sync conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Implement timestamp-based conflict resolution
   - Fallback: Manual conflict resolution for critical data

### User Adoption Risks
1. **Low digital literacy among farmers**
   - Mitigation: Simple UI, WhatsApp support group, video tutorials
   - Testing: Usability testing with representative users in Weeks 10-11

2. **Trust concerns (verification system)**
   - Mitigation: Clear verification process, visible admin actions
   - Testing: User interviews to assess trust levels

3. **Limited smartphone access**
   - Mitigation: Ensure desktop compatibility, SMS fallbacks
   - Backup: Partner with community centers for shared access
